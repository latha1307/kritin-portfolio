        Media & UX program, I made New Parent. </h1>
        <p>Parenting is one of the biggest responsibilities and with fast-paced digital lifestyles, I wish New Parent to be a helpful tool for all the parents. And the goal for ‘New Parent’ was to create an app which makes parents life easy and be more aware of all the important aspects of their babies in general.</p>
