            <span className="block mt-5"> Frustrated by the constant struggle to manage schedules, track milestones, and simply find moments to connect with our children, a group of friends and I began brainstorming. We sought a solution that would streamline the chaos, allowing parents to truly savor the precious, fleeting moments of early childhood. This realization fueled the creation of my app, designed to alleviate the pressures of new parenthood.</span></div>
        <div className="text-left mt-20 text-[26px]  md:text-[30px] font-medium text-[#DB4A2B]">Initial sketches</div>
        <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-5 text-zinc-400"> <span className="text-[26px] mt-5 text-white"> My initial sketches were rapid and iterative, focusing on capturing the essential functionalities. </span> 

            <span className="block mt-5">I prioritized visualizing the user flow, mapping out how parents would navigate the app to complete key tasks like scheduling feeding times, tracking milestones, and sharing photos. These sketches were intentionally low-fidelity, allowing for quick exploration of various layouts and interactions. I used pen and paper to freely explore different ideas, iterating on each screen based on user needs.</span> </div>

      These initial sketches and wireframes served as a crucial foundation for the app's development, enabling me to validate key design decisions and iterate on the user experience. This process allowed me to move into the prototyping phase with a clear understanding of the app's core functionalities and user needs.

        <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-5 text-zinc-400">Building upon user insights gained from paper prototype testing, I moved into low-fidelity prototyping. This iterative process allowed me to refine the app's features, directly addressing identified user pain points. Using Figma, I then developed digital wireframes to solidify the app's structure and visualize the user experience.</div>
      <div  className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-5 text-zinc-400">The first wireframes had five main tabs in the bottom navigation: Home, Daily log, Moments, Parenting and Music. The Home screen layout was structured into distinct sections displaying your baby information, upcoming vaccination and slide show of recent photos of your baby.</div>
      <div className="flex justify-center mt-10">
      <img src={Parent15} alt="parent" className="w-40 sm:w-52 md:w-72 rounded-lg border-violet-300 border-4" />

      </div>

      <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-10 text-zinc-400">
      Wireframes were created for two main features: logging daily baby activity and photo moment capture. The Daily log wireframe incorporates a calendar for streamlined date selection and log retrieval, with dedicated sections for key baby care aspects such as sleep, feeding, and crying. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Likewise parents can also track their baby’s vaccination. The core of the screen features a chronological list of recommended vaccinations, segmented by the child's age in months. Each section clearly outlines the vaccines due at that specific age, with a visual indicator (thumbs-up icon) suggesting a potential mechanism for parents to mark completed vaccinations.

      <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-10 text-zinc-400">
      Inspired by Instagram, the Moments feature offers a familiar and user-friendly way to capture, organize, and treasure those special baby moments in a single, accessible location.

      <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-5 text-zinc-400">After creating the initial wireframes, I developed a low-fidelity prototype to gather early feedback. The first prototype tested the flow of logging daily data’s of your child and add photos of your child in Moments.</div>
      <div className="md:text-[22px] text-[20px] mt-5 text-zinc-400">User testing revealed the need to simplify app’s user flow and reduce feature overload to enhance user experience. The data entry process was also identified as a pain point, with users seeking a more efficient and less time-consuming method.</div>
